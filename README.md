# 🛡️ macOS Educational Keylogger

This project is a Python-based keylogger built exclusively for **ethical and educational purposes**. Designed to run on **macOS**, it demonstrates how input capture works, how operating systems manage permissions, and how attackers might simulate malicious behavior — so defenders can understand, detect, and prevent it.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This tool is for personal learning and cybersecurity training only. Do not run this on any machine without full knowledge and consent.
